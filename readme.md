# Introduction to Offensive Security For Web Developers

This repository is a collection of materials to support training and workshops about the fundamentals of offensive security (AKA "hacking" and "penetration testing") with regards to web applications. The training may serve as a starting point for people interested in ethical hacking, penetration testing, application security, and network security. That said, the material has been built with defensive security in mind. As Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War:

> If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

Lessons include descriptions of common attacks, advice for executing such attacks, and defensive strategies to prevent and mitigate such attacks.

## About These Materials

These materials are primarily designed with instructors in mind. To that end, the files in the `lessons` folder are organized as lesson plans, with advice and scaffolding for leading a workshop. Students may, of course, find them useful as a reference during (and after) class. Some students may also find them useful for self study, even though they cater to experienced instructors.

Additionally, the files in the `exercises` folder are all a small amount of scaffolding on top of publicly available CTF exercises. Solutions for these CTFs are *not* provided, but some clues about how to approach them are provided, including which lessons are applicable to the particular CTF. Most of the CTFs do already have solutions that can be quickly found on Google but — for both pedagogical reasons and because HackerOne discourages publication of solutions — we have chosen not to publish any solutions.

## Public Domain Education
