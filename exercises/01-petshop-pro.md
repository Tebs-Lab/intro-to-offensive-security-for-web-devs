# Exercise One: PetShopPro

Navigate to the HackerOne CTFs [https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf](https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf) and select "Petshop Pro". This is an easy box, and its default position is about halfway through the list. Ctrl-F can be your friend!

This exercise requires the first 3 attack types from this course:

* Automated enumeration.
* Password spraying.
* Cross site scripting.

## Note For Instructors:

* The password spraying portion can be very slow with the free version of Burp. Provide students with a short list of usernames and passwords that contain the correct answer combination unless you teach students to use an alternate (faster) tool.
