# Exercise 2: TicketTastic

Navigate to the HackerOne CTFs [https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf](https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf) and select "TicketTastic". This is a moderate box, and its default position is about one quarter of the way through the list. Ctrl-F can be your friend!

This exercise requires the 4th and 5th attack types discussed in class:

* Request forgery
* SQL injection

## A Note For Students

You'll notice that there are two "TicketTastic" options available â€” the "Live Instance" and the "Demo Instance". You have to capture the flags on the Live Instance, but you'll have full visibility into how the application works on the Demo Instance. Do yourself a favor and explore/enumerate/recon the Demo app first.
