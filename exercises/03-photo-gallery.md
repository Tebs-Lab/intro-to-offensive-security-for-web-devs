# Exercise 3: Photo Gallery

Navigate to the HackerOne CTFs [https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf](https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf) and select "Photo Gallery". This is a moderate box, and its default position is near the top of the list. Ctrl-F can be your friend!

This exercise requires some combination of the attacks discussed for the previous CTFs and command injection.

## Note to Students

After this, you should have learned enough to successfully capture all the flags on:

* Postbook,
* Micro-CMS (V1 and V2), and
* Cody's First Blog.

If you finish early, try one of those... Happy hunting!
