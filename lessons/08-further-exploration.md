# Further Exploration

Students had a day of setup and practice with some useful security tools. What can they do to continue the journey? This is not comprehensive, of course, but some of these communities are great for beginners and will lead you to even more information.

### HackerOne's CTFs and Intro Materials:

HackerOne is a bug bounty platform, and they also provide some good (and free) educational materials. We used the HackerOne CTFs, so this is a very easy way to keep going.

* https://www.hacker101.com/

If you sign up on HackerOne they send you a PDF copy of a book, the book is a few years old but it's very practical and pretty helpful. It describes several real attacks that hackers received payouts for in bug bounty programs. They also have a video series which is pretty dry, but  have good information. Plus, they also provide several CTFs where you can practice the tactic described in the videos. Double plus, if you worked through this class, you're already familiar with HackerOne and the CTFs.

### Reddit & Medium:

There are some good hacking communities on Reddit. If you're a user consider subscribing to:

    https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking — general hacking, tools, writeups, guides, discussion...
    https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/ — news about network security, esp. good for recently disclosed vulnerabilities.
    https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/ — hacking education

It's Reddit, so the qualities varies wildly post to post, from script kiddies to some serious professionals, but the good stuff still floats to the top pretty often.

On Medium I've started following this publication, where people write about successful hacks, typically from bug bounty programs: https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup. These are not always the MOST understandable, hackers are not always the best writers, but they're useful and interesting often enough.

### HackTheBox, Really Good CTFs:

https://www.hackthebox.eu/

HackTheBox a more community driven CTF community. The challenges posted here are often related to recently published Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits (CVE), which means it's not just an archive of hacks that worked a long time ago. These challenges often get published while many machines are still unpatched, meaning they're often quite realistic.

Another thing that was really helpful for getting started on HTB was IppSec's videos. He does walk-throughs for "retired" boxes on HTB, and it was really helpful to see his workflow and systematic approach, especially what he does to get started with a new IP address:

### Certificate Programs

* Offensive Security (the group that maintains Kali) offers a lot of training and certificate programs: https://www.offensive-security.com/courses-and-certifications/
* So does the non-profit The International Information System Security Certification Consortium: https://www.isc2.org/
